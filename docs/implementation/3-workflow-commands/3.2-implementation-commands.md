# 3.2 Implementation Commands

Commands for creating implementation outlines and detailed specifications.

## Goals

- Transform PRD goals into actionable implementation structure
- Create hierarchical specs: Areas → Task Groups → Tasks
- Support incremental detailing at different scopes

## Commands

- `impl.outline` — Create high-level implementation areas
- `impl.create` — Add detailed tasks to areas or task groups

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: PRD should exist (`docs/prd.md`)
- **Enables**: Structured coding sessions, progress tracking

---

## 3.2.1. impl.outline Command

**Goal**: Create implementation area structure from PRD

**Approach**:
- Read PRD goals and requirements
- Propose major implementation areas
- Create `docs/implementation/overview.md` with area list
- Create directory and index.md for each area

**Key Features**:
- Analyzes PRD to suggest logical areas
- Proposes with preview before creating
- Creates directory structure automatically

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Creates overview.md with numbered areas
- Each area has directory and index.md
- Areas map to PRD goals

**Status**: ✅ Complete

## 3.2.2. impl.create Command

**Goal**: Add detailed task groups and tasks to implementation specs

**Approach**:
- Work at different scopes: full project, one area, one task group
- Propose task breakdown based on scope
- Create task group files with individual tasks

**Key Features**:
- Scope selection: `/impl.create`, `/impl.create 1-auth`, `/impl.create 1.2`
- Right-sized tasks (roughly one coding session each)
- Clear acceptance criteria for each task

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Creates `{N}.{M}-topic.md` files with tasks
- Tasks have Goal, Approach, Acceptance Criteria, Status
- Updates area index.md with task group links

**Status**: ✅ Complete
