# 1.3 Impl Reconcile

Command for updating implementation documentation based on actual work done.

## Goals

- Update task statuses to reflect completed work
- Add missing tasks that were implemented but not documented
- Mark areas as complete when all tasks are done

## Constraints

- Must preserve existing task structure and numbering
- Should detect both additions and completions
- Needs to analyze code changes to understand what was implemented

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: Implementation overview must exist (`docs/implementation/overview.md`)
- **Enables**: `docs.reconcile` (uses this command)

## 1.3.1. Create impl.reconcile Command

**Goal**: Update implementation docs to reflect work that was done

**Approach**:
- Analyze commits for implementation work
- Map changes to existing task groups and tasks
- Update status indicators (🔵 → 🟡 → ✅)
- Propose new tasks for work not covered by existing specs

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Command updates task statuses based on git history
- Proposes new task groups for uncategorized work
- Shows preview before applying changes
- Supports one-shot mode with explicit scope

**Status**: ✅ Complete

## 1.3.2. Implement Status Detection

**Goal**: Automatically determine task completion status from code

**Approach**:
- Analyze file changes in commits
- Match against acceptance criteria in task specs
- Detect patterns indicating completion (tests added, docs updated)
- Present findings for user confirmation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Correctly identifies completed tasks
- Detects in-progress work
- Handles tasks with no clear file mapping
- Allows user override of detected statuses

**Status**: ✅ Complete
