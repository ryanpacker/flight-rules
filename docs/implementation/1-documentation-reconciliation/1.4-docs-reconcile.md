# 1.4 Docs Reconcile

Orchestration command that runs all reconcile commands and performs cross-document consistency checking.

## Goals

- Provide single command to reconcile all documentation
- Detect inconsistencies between README, PRD, and implementation docs
- Present unified view of documentation health

## Constraints

- Must run individual reconcile commands in sequence
- Cross-check must analyze relationships, not just individual files
- Should work even when no code changes have occurred (pure consistency check)

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: `readme.reconcile`, `prd.reconcile`, `impl.reconcile`
- **Enables**: Complete documentation health check

## 1.4.1. Create docs.reconcile Command

**Goal**: Orchestrate all reconciliation and check cross-document consistency

**Approach**:
1. Run `readme.reconcile`
2. Run `prd.reconcile`
3. Run `impl.reconcile`
4. Perform cross-document consistency check
5. Present unified summary

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Runs all three reconcile commands in sequence
- Aggregates results into single summary
- Cross-check identifies inconsistencies
- Supports one-shot mode with explicit scope

**Status**: ✅ Complete

## 1.4.2. Implement Cross-Document Consistency Check

**Goal**: Detect when documentation files contradict each other

**Approach**:
- Compare README features against PRD goals
- Verify implementation areas match PRD goals
- Check task statuses align with claimed completions
- Detect orphaned references (goals without tasks, tasks without goals)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Detects README/PRD mismatches
- Detects PRD/implementation mismatches
- Flags status inconsistencies (e.g., PRD says complete, impl says planned)
- Provides actionable suggestions for each inconsistency

**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## 1.4.3. Standalone Consistency Mode

**Goal**: Allow running cross-check without reconciliation

**Approach**:
- Add flag or separate command for consistency-only mode
- Skip git analysis, only analyze current document state
- Useful for periodic documentation health checks

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Can run without analyzing git history
- Produces clear report of inconsistencies
- Suggests which document to update for each issue

**Status**: ✅ Complete
