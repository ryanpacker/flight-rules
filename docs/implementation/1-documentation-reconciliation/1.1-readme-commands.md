# 1.1 README Commands

Commands for creating and reconciling the project README.

## Goals

- Generate comprehensive READMEs from PRD and project state
- Update existing READMEs to reflect current reality
- Detect whether to create or update based on existing content

## Constraints

- Must read from multiple sources: PRD, implementation docs, package.json
- Should preserve user customizations when updating
- Both commands support conversational and one-shot modes

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: None (can run independently)
- **Enables**: `docs.reconcile` (uses these commands)

## 1.1.1. Create readme.create Command

**Goal**: Generate a README from scratch based on PRD and current project state

**Approach**:
- Read PRD for overview, goals, and key concepts
- Read package.json for project metadata
- Analyze implementation docs for current status
- Generate structured README with installation, usage, and development sections

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Command creates README.md at project root
- README includes: overview, installation, usage, development, license
- Content is derived from existing documentation, not fabricated
- Warns if README already exists

**Status**: 🔵 Planned

## 1.1.2. Create readme.reconcile Command

**Goal**: Update existing README to reflect current project state

**Approach**:
- Analyze commits since last documented session
- Compare README content against PRD and implementation reality
- Propose specific updates with previews
- Preserve user customizations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Command detects undocumented changes
- Shows preview of proposed updates before applying
- Supports one-shot mode with explicit scope
- Handles case where no README exists (suggests readme.create)

**Status**: 🔵 Planned
