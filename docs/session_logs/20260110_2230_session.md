## Session Goals

- Publish flight-rules package to npm with `dev` tag
- Update documentation to reflect early development status

## Related Specs

- N/A (operational task, no implementation spec)

## Summary

Published `flight-rules` v0.5.9 to the npm registry. The package is now installable via `npm install -g flight-rules@dev`. Updated README with early development banner and npm installation instructions.

## Implementation Details

- Added `publishConfig.tag: "dev"` to package.json so future publishes default to the dev tag
- Updated README installation instructions from GitHub tarball to npm @dev
- Added early development banner to README header
- Used granular npm access token with 2FA bypass for authentication

## Key Decisions

- **Dev tag strategy**: Used `publishConfig` in package.json rather than relying on manual `--tag dev` flags
- **Latest tag acceptance**: npm requires every package to have a `latest` tag. Accepted that both `latest` and `dev` point to 0.5.9, relying on README banner to communicate early development status

## Challenges & Solutions

- **npm 2FA requirement**: Initial publish failed due to 2FA. Resolved by creating a granular access token with 2FA bypass enabled on npmjs.com
- **~/.npmrc misconfiguration**: Token wasn't being read due to filename typo. Fixed by ensuring correct filename
- **Latest tag removal**: Attempted to remove `latest` tag but npm doesn't allow this. Accepted the limitation since README already warns users

## Code Areas Touched

- `README.md` - Early dev banner, installation instructions, release docs
- `package.json` - Added publishConfig.tag

## Spec Updates Needed

- None (no existing spec for npm publishing)

## Next Steps

- Monitor for user feedback on the package
- Consider placeholder version for `latest` tag if confusion arises
- Continue development toward v1.0 stability

## Learnings

- npm automatically sets `latest` tag on first publish regardless of specified tag
- Granular access tokens with 2FA bypass require correct setup in ~/.npmrc
- publishConfig in package.json is the clean way to default to a specific tag
